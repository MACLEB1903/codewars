Instructions:
In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function.
Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not).
The function needs to return either a true or false.
Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.
Floats are considered UNeven for this kata.

export const testEven = (n : number) : boolean => n % 2 == 0
