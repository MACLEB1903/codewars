Instructions:
Baby is just learning to talk, and is starting out with easy common everyday words. You want to encourage your baby to talk more, so you repeat the random words they learned. When baby says a word, you repeat the word twice back at baby. Write a function to illustrate this exercise.

ie: 
baby says("yum");
you say("yum yum");

*/

function babyRepeat(babble) {
  return babble.repeat(2);
}
