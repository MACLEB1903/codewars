Instructions:
In languages that use UTF-16 encoding for strings (JavaScript, JVM languages like Java, .NET languages like C#...), if the code point of a character is larger than 0xFFFF, it will be treated as two code units.

For example:
The code point of the emoji ðŸ™‰ (U+1F649, Hear-No-Evil Monkey) is 0x1F649.
'ðŸ™‰'.length // 

Write a function that returns the number of codepoints in a UTF-16 string.
"abcd"   --> 4
"ðŸ™‰"     --> 1
"ðŸ˜¸ðŸ¦ŒðŸš€" --> 3
