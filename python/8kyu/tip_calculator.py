Instructions:
Complete the function, which calculates how much you need to tip based on the total amount of the bill and the service. 

You need to consider the following ratings:
Terrible: tip 0%
Poor: tip 5%
Good: tip 10%
Great: tip 15%
Excellent: tip 20%

The rating is case insensitive (so "great" = "GREAT"). If an unrecognised rating is received, then you need to return:
"Rating not recognised" in Javascript, Python and Ruby...
...or null in Java
...or -1 in C#

Because you're a nice person, you always round up the tip, regardless of the service.
