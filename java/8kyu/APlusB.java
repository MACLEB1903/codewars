Instructions:
Vasya Pupkin just started learning Java and C#. At first, he decided to write simple program that was supposed to sum up two small numbers (numbers and their sum fit in a byte), but it didn't work. Vasya was too sad to find out what is wrong. Help him to correct the mistake.

public class FirstClass {
    public static byte sum (byte a, byte b) {
        return (byte) (a + b);
    }
}
