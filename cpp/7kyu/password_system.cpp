Instructions:
In Star Labs we use password system to unlock the lab doors and only Team Flash is given the password for these labs. The password system is made of a n x n keypad (n > 0).
One day Zoom saw Cisco using the password. He figured out that the password is symmetric about the centre point (the centre point for a n x n keypad will be the point with co-ordinates (n / 2, n / 2)). Now he has to try all possible symmetric combinations to unlock the door. Since he does not have enough time, he asks you to determine whether a given password is symmetric or not.
You will be given a flattened n x n binary grid containing elements as 0 if that key is not used and 1 if that key is used. You need to tell whether the given binary grid is symmetric according to the centre point. The grid might not be square; in that case you should return "No".

Your Task:
Write a function that takes an one-dimensional array of integers containing 0 and 1 as input and returning "Yes" or "No" depending on whether the given password is symmetric or not.

Example:
[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1] => "Yes"

The given password is symmetric about the centre point. For ease of understanding, the above 1D array can be represented as follows:
  1  1  0
  0  0  0
  0  1  1
[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1] => "No"

This array cannot be represented as a n x n matrix, so it's     invalid.
[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] => "No"

This password is not symmetric along the centre point.
